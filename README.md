# Data Analysis with Python Course

This repository contains code and data files for following along with the [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/#data-analysis-with-python-course) course on freeCodeCamp. The project is organised into several directories, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis using Python.

## Projects

The following folders contain projects that I made to gain the certification:

- **mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator**: Contains a project that calculates statistical measures like the mean, variance, standard deviation, sum, max and min for a 3x3 matrix on the entire matrix, the 1st axis and 2nd. This also contains test cases for this code.

## Notes and Exercises

The following folders contain notes and exercises taken during the course:

- **data-cleaning**: Contains scripts for cleaning and preprocessing data.
- **numpy**: Contains scripts demonstrating various operations using the NumPy library.
- **pandas**: Contains scripts demonstrating data manipulation using the Pandas library.
- **reading-data**: Contains scripts demonstrating how to read different types of data files.
- **RMOTR Data Science Curriculum**: Contains exercises and data files for the RMOTR Data Science Curriculum.
